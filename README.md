# Drawing-Multiple-Shapes

This repository contains code I made whilst studying Object Oriented Programming(OOP) at Swinburne University.
The program here is one of my first programs I've created at university that draws multiple shapes with a click of the mouse using a 
Swinburne Library depending on which shape is selected. 


### Interesting Facts
* The user can select shapes by pressing the designated button for the shape they
want to draw (C for circle, L for Line and R for a Rectangle).

* The shapes have pre set dimentions so they cannot be changed.

* This program gave me knowledge on essential OOP concepts like inheritence and polymorphism.
